# Classical-Music-Movement-Recognition

This repository contains code for a project that uses machine learning to predict the movement of a classical music piece. Two models are implemented: a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

## Requirements
    Python 3.x
    NumPy
    Scikit-learn
    TensorFlow
    Keras
    Seaborn
    Matplotlib
    Librosa
You can install all the required packages using the following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
    Preprocessing: Run the preprocessing section of the code to convert your .wav audio files into mel spectrograms.

    SVM Model: To train and evaluate the SVM model, run the SVM section of the code.

    RNN Model: To train and evaluate the RNN model, run the RNN section of the code.
